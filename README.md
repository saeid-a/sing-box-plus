Sing-Box + Blocking Bypass Hacks = ❤️

### TLS Fragmentation
Fragments TLS ClientHello packets in multiple segments such that the SNI extension is guaranteed to split, making it harder to drop connections based on SNI filtering.
Enable it by adding the `tls_fragment` entry to any outbound connection:

```
...
"outbounds": [
        {
            "type": "direct",
            "tag": "direct"
        },
        {
            "type": "direct",
            "tag": "fragment",
            "tcp_fast_open": false,
            "tls_fragment": {
                "enabled": true,
                "size": "20-100",
                "sleep": "0-2"
            }
        },
...
```
